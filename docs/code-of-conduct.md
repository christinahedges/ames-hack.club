# Code of Conduct

*Note: Ames Hack Club adopts the same Code of Conduct as Gaia Sprints and TESS.ninja*

General Code of Conduct
The Ames Hack Club (AHC) organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment, abusive behavior, or intimidation of conference participants in any form. As such, we follow the [AAS Code of Ethics](https://aas.org/ethics), and expect all participants to read and abide by the statements in the [AAS Code of Ethics](https://aas.org/ethics).

Collaboration Policy
All participants at every AHC Hack Day will be expected to openly share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results. Project development will proceed out in the open, among participants and in the world.

Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new collaborations, and combine projects. Any participant who contributes significantly to a project can expect co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any participant who gets significant contributions to a project is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.

These rules make it inadvisable to bring proprietary data sets or proprietary code to any AHC Hack Day, unless the participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them or add collaborators.

We additionally ask participants to abide by the Research and Publication and Authorship guidelines of the [AAS Code of Ethics](https://aas.org/ethics).
