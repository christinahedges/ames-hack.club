# Hello World

Ames Hack Club is a group of scientists who meet several times a year to hack on science problems at NASA Ames. You can learn more about AHC at our [FAQ Page](faq.md). Our next hack day is coming on [{{ page.date }}](#upcoming-hack-day).

## What is a hack day?

A hack is a small project, with a clear goal, which should be **completed** by the end of the day. Here we use "hack" to mean *take a quick approach to solving a complex problem.* Hacking could mean taking a new approach to a theoretical problem, software problem, hardware problem, or just about anything!

## What should I do at the hack day?

1. Try something **new**
2. Try to work with **someone new**
3. It's okay to fail, or for a project not to come together
4. Be bold.
5. Be kind.
6. Everyone has experience that we value, we want to hear from everyone.
7. Listen.

## What is the schedule?

* **{{ page.time }}** Short intro and pitches
* **Hack Time**
* **{{ page.end-time }}** Presentations and wrap up slides

### Pitches

At the beginning of the hack day we will have pitches. Any participant can stand up for 1 minute, explain the challenge they would like to work on, and pitch their idea for a hack. If you have something you'd like to pitch, be ready to stand up with the mic and pitch it to everyone at 9am!
