# Hello World

Ames Hack Club is a group of scientists who meet several times a year to hack on science problems at NASA Ames. You can learn more about AHC at our [FAQ Page](faq.md). Our next hack day is coming on [{{ page.date }}](#upcoming-hack-day).

## What is a hack day?

A hack is a small project, with a clear goal, which should be **completed** by the end of the day. Here we use "hack" to mean *take a quick approach to solving a complex problem.* Hacking could mean taking a new approach to a theoretical problem, software problem, hardware problem, or just about anything!

## What should I do at the hack day?

1. Try something new
2. Work with someone new
3. It’s okay to fail!
4. Be bold and Be kind.
5. Listen! Everyone has experience that we value, we want to hear from everyone.

## What is the schedule?

* **{{ page.time }}** Short intro and pitches
* **Hack Time**
* **{{ page.end-time }}** Presentations and wrap up slides

### Pitches

At the beginning of the hack day we will have pitches. Any participant can stand up for 1 minute, explain the challenge they would like to work on, and pitch their idea for a hack. If you have something you'd like to pitch, be ready to stand up with the mic and pitch it to everyone at 9am!
