### What is Ames Hack Club?

AHC is a group of scientists at NASA Ames who meet 2-4 times a year to collaborate and hack on science projects.

### Can I join Ames Hack Club?

If you're a scientist at Ames, simply sign up for the next hack using our form. If you're outside Ames and want to collaborate in a hack day, get in touch. The more interest we have from people outside Ames, the easier it will be for us to set up a hack day that can include non-Ames scientists!

### How do I sign up?

Check out our [upcoming hack day]({{ site.url }}/ames-hack.club/#upcoming-hack-day)

### Where is the hack day?

Hack days take place at Ames, inside the gates, in the collaborative space.


### Who should I talk to about the hack day?

If you need to get in touch you can either send an internal email to Christina Hedges at NASA Ames, or you can open an [issue](https://github.com/christinahedges/ames-hack.club/issues) on our github repo and we'll get back to you.
